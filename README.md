# Media-Scripts

Misc scripts and tools. Undocumented scripts probably do what I need them to but aren't finished yet.

## Requirements

1. A system that can run Python 3.7
1. Python 3.7 installed on that system

One of the requirements of these scripts is alive-progress 2.4.1, which requires python 3.7.

## Setup

1. clone repo
1. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` [I'd suggest doing this in a virtual environment]
1. cd to desired directory
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
1. Edit .env to suit

All these scripts use the same `.env` and requirements.

## Plex scripts:

 1. user-emails.py - extract user emails from your shares
 2. reset-posters-tmdb.py - reset all artwork in a library to TMDB default
 3. reset-posters-plex.py - reset all artwork in a library to Plex default
 4. grab-current-posters.py - Grab currently-set posters and optionally background artwork
 5. grab-all-posters.py - grab some or all of the artwork for a library from plex
 6. grab-all-status.py - grab watch status for all users all libraries from plex
 7. apply-all-status.py - apply watch status for all users all libraries to plex from the file emitted by the previous script
 8. show-all-playlists.py - Show contents of all user playlists
 9. delete-collections.py - delete most or all collections from one or more libraries
